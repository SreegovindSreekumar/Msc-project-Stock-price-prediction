Topic: Stock Price Prediction by using the Tehran Stock Exchange 


Purpose: 
The purpose of this project is to develop and evaluate predictive models for stock prices on the Tehran Stock Exchange. By using the historical stock data, the project employs ARIMA, and LSTM models to forecast future stock prices. The goal is to identify the most accurate model for predicting price trends and assist investors in making informed decisions. This repository includes data preprocessing scripts, model training procedures, and evaluation metrics to assess each model's performance. The project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of different forecasting techniques and their effectiveness in stock price prediction.
This code is for predicting stock prices for the Tehran Stock Exchange using two different models:  ARIMA, and LSTM. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to determine the most accurate forecasting method.
